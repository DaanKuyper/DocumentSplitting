ABSTRACT = {Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of identifying and converting texts rendered in images using pixels to a more computer-friendly representation. The presented work aims to prove that the accuracy of the Tesseract 4.0 OCR engine can be further enhanced by employing convolution-based preprocessing using specific kernels. As Tesseract 4.0 has proven great performance when evaluated against a favorable input, its capability of properly detecting and identifying characters in more realistic, unfriendly images is questioned. The article proposes an adaptive image preprocessing step guided by a reinforcement learning model, which attempts to minimize the edit distance between the recognized text and the ground truth. It is shown that this approach can boost the character-level accuracy of Tesseract 4.0 from 0.134 to 0.616 (+359% relative change) and the F1 score from 0.163 to 0.729 (+347% relative change) on a dataset that is considered challenging by its authors.},
